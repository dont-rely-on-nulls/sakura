* About

Domino is a **Relational Algebra Engine** implements relational
algebra in its strict, theoretical form, adhering rigorously to the
principles of relational theory as articulated by E. F. Codd.

A relation is modeled as a set of tuples, each tuple being a set of
attributes. Each attribute is a pairing of a name with a value drawn
from a domain. All operations are defined on entire relations as sets,
with no recourse to the compromises typical of SQL or other practical
implementations.

The engine is intended as a study in correctness: each operation, from
projection to join, is executed in a manner consistent with the
classical definition of relational algebra. It is a platform for
exploring the consequences of relational theory in a low-level
programming context, providing both a tool for experimentation and a
concrete realization of the abstract model.
